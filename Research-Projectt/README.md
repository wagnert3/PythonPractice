Research Project - PROG 1024 - Advanced Topics Web Development

Description
This is a term project where you will pick a topic to learn and then teach it back to the class.

Rules
The topic MUST be approved by the instructor before work begins
You will work in teams of two unless otherwise approved by the instructor
The "teach back" presentation should take a minimum of 1.75 hours to a maximum of 2
hours to complete. Both team members must fully participate. If there is a student doing the project alone, then it should take a minimum of 1 hour to a maximum of 2 hours to complete.

Requirements include:
-PowerPoint Presentation
-A demo that you will walk the class through so they can see how it works. Something
that the class can follow along with you would work best.
-An assignment/activity where you will assist as needed. A solution must be provided at
the end of the presentation. If time permits, it may be a good idea to go through the
assignment/activity together with the class
-Documentation of the resources you used to learn your topic.
-I will schedule an appropriate time for you. Presentations will start during the week of March

ALL team members MUST know their topic well enough to teach back to your peers and
answer any questions from the instructor and/or peers about your topic.
